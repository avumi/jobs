##### **Welcome to Avumi's Careers Page !**

***

## What is Avumi ?

Avumi is developing a **high impact tech product** for the **eCommerce fashion** industry. Our product is industry-facing, but designed to be owned and controlled by online customers. Using a combination of **3D imaging technologies** and **artificial intelligence**, it will allow users to visualise an item of clothing on a realistic personal avatar and thereby answer two key questions:
* Does it fit me? (the “fit hurdle”)
* Does it look good on me? (the “style hurdle”)

## Our culture

If you're looking to join a startup looking to conquer the digital world, you've come to the right place !

At Avumi, everything is possible and there are no bad ideas. We're in that point in time where we're still building things and every new person can have a direct input on our product. If you decide to join us, you'll not only help us build the Avumi Platform, but also be part of building our culture as a tech company.


We currently speak :fr: :uk: (fluently).

Here's how we work :

* One-team : whatever your job at Avumi, we'll always be looking for your input and creativity.

* Adventure : you'll have time to take risks and test things, even if they don't work out in the end.

* Results : taking risks is good, getting somewhere is better. We work to get things done.

* Pioneer : we never say "it can't be done", we just find a solution.

* Agile : we're adaptive, everything is possible.

* Value-oriented : if it doesn't serve our clients or productivity, add it to the back-log.



## The stack

* Front-end :desktop_computer: : VueJS, HTML5/CSS3, JS, etc.

* Back-end :back: :end: : Python, AWS EC2, lambda, API Gateway, RDS, Cloudformation, SNS/SES, etc.

* Devops :hammer_and_wrench: : Docker, AWS, Github, Jira

## Where you'll work

It doesn't matter where you work. It's all about getting the job done, staying in touch and being part of an exciting project.

To keep everyone safe, remote work will be the rule during COVID-19 with periodical face-to-face meetings.
