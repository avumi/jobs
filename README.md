##### **Welcome to Avumi's Careers Page !**

## What is Avumi ?

Avumi is developing a **high impact tech product** for the **eCommerce fashion** industry. Our product is industry-facing, but designed to be owned and controlled by online customers. Using a combination of **3D imaging technologies** and **artificial intelligence**, it will allow users to visualise an item of clothing on a realistic personal avatar and thereby answer two key questions:
* Does it fit me? (the “fit hurdle”)
* Does it look good on me? (the “style hurdle”)

## Our culture

If your're looking to join a fresh startup looking to conquer the world, you've come to the right place !

At Avumi, everything is possible and there are no bad ideas. We're in that point in time where we're still building things and every new person can have a direct input on our product. If you decide to join us, you'll not only be working for Avumi, *you* will be Avumi. You'll not only help us build the Avumi Platform, but also be part of building our ethos as a tech company.

We currently speak :fr: :uk: :es:.

Here's how we work :

* One-team : whatever your job at Avumi, we'll always be looking for your input and creativity.

* Adventure : you'll have time to take risks and test things, even if they don't work out in the end.

* Results : taking risks is good, getting somewhere is better. We work to get things done.

* Pioneer : we never say "it can't be done", we just find a solution.

* Agile : we're adaptive, everything is possible.

* Value-oriented : if it doesn't serve our clients or productivity, add it to the back-log.
