## About the role

Working together with our Lead Machine Learning Engineer, you will primarily be working on processing and analysing video streams from mobile app users. 
We offer a great deal of flexibility and will let you choose the machine learning and computer vision project you want to work on. 

Some of the projects include:
* Processing and analysing video streams from mobile app users. This entails frame identification to detect when a user directly faces the camera or is turned sideways.
* Researching and evaluating different algorithms for virtual try-on

Apart from these suggestions, we are very open to hear your perspective if you think something else would be valuable to work on. Most of the machine learning tasks will involve working with basic computer vision concepts, such as object detection, key point detection, human pose estimation, instance segmentation, image pre-processing, blur estimation, etc. You will work together with our Lead Machine Learning Engineer who will guide in your project, check-in with you regularly, and help you debug your program.

Internship may result in permanent contract.
